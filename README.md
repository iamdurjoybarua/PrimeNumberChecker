# Prime Number Checker (Java)

This Java program determines whether a positive integer entered by the user is a prime number.

## Description

The program prompts the user to enter a positive integer. It then checks if the number is prime using an optimized algorithm (checking divisibility only up to the square root of the number). The result is printed to the console. The program also includes a `try-finally` block to ensure that the `Scanner` resource is closed properly.

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Save the code:** Save the Java code as `PrimeNumberChecker.java`.

2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Compile the code using the Java compiler:

    ```bash
    javac PrimeNumberChecker.java
    ```

3.  **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program:

    ```bash
    java PrimeNumberChecker
    ```

4.  **Input:** The program will prompt you to enter a positive integer. Type the integer and press Enter.

5.  **Output:** The program will then display whether the entered number is a prime number or not.
